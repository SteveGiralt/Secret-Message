This is an extremely simple secret messaging app I worked on while learning Javascript. 

I made some modifications from the original: manipulating the user's clipboard, styling with MaterialUI, 
and a few other minor tweaks. This is a fun little one. Users visit the site and enter their message
which gets encoded to Base64 and handed back to the user as a URL. They can send it to their friends who
then decode using the site.
